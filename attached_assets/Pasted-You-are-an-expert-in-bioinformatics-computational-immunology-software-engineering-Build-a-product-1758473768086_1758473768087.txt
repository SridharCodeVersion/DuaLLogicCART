You are an expert in bioinformatics + computational immunology software engineering. Build a production-ready, reproducible tool that helps clinicians design dual-logic CAR-T strategies for PDAC using the provided biomarker dataset.

Input

CSV file with:

biomarker_name

category

indication (↑ oncogenic, ↓ suppressor)

Core Features

Antigen Pair Selection

Clinician selects any 2 biomarkers (provide a dropdown or table of options for selection of antigen pairs as per the dataset)
Provide separate inputs for selecting 2 tumor antigens and 2 healthy cell antigens

System compares tumor vs healthy expression (fold-change, indication).

Truth Table & Gate Suggestion

Generate truth tables for AND/OR/NOT/XOR/XNOR (hard + probabilistic).

Rank gates by selectivity score = tumor kill / (healthy kill + ε).

Recommend the best gate and provide a 2 line explaination giving concise reason why the gate was chosen?

CAR-T Diagram Builder (Unique Feature)

Dynamically generate a labeled CAR-T structure based on selected antigens.

Include standard components:

scFv domains (mapped to selected antigens, labeled with biomarker names)

Hinge region

Transmembrane domain

Costimulatory domain (CD28/4-1BB)

CD3ζ signaling domain

Personalize the diagram: labels show patient-specific antigen names.

Output as downloadable PNG/SVG for clinician reference.

Outputs

Truth tables (CSV/JSON + visual matrix)

Best logic gate recommendation with explanation

Personalized CAR-T diagram with labeled components

Tech Requirements

Backend: Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy)

Visualization: Matplotlib / Plotly (truth tables, CAR-T diagram)

UI: Streamlit or Flask for dataset upload, antigen selection, results, and diagram display

Deployable on Replit (no GPU).

Deliverables

Modular Git repo with code + sample dataset

Web UI runnable on Replit

Example outputs (truth tables, diagrams, reports)
