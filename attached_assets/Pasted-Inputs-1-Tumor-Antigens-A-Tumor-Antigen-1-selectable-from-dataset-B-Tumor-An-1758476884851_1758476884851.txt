Inputs: 
1. Tumor Antigens: 
   - A = Tumor Antigen 1 (selectable from dataset)
   - B = Tumor Antigen 2 (selectable from dataset)
   - Optional C = Tumor Antigen 3 (for three-input logic)
2. Healthy Antigens: select from dataset for safety visualization.
3. Logic Gate: select from OR, AND, XOR, XNOR, NOT.

Requirements:

1. **Truth Table Generation**:
   - Create separate columns for inputs A and B, labeled with the **actual antigen names selected by the user**.
   - Output column: Y (0 or 1).
   - Explanation column: 
     - 1 → Activate (Kill)
     - 0 → Deactivate (Off)
   - Remove unnecessary columns: cell type, probabilistic output, and pattern diagrams.
   - Only include relevant logic for the selected gate.

2. **Personalized CAR-T Cell Diagram**:
   - Draw a visually appealing CAR-T cell diagram including all standard components: scFv, hinge, transmembrane, co-stimulatory and signaling domains.
   - Label tumor antigens (inputs) and healthy antigens clearly, making them visually distinguishable.
   - Show the killing action of CAR-T cells:
     - Highlight tumor antigens targeted for activation (Y=1) with action arrows or color coding.
     - Show OFF/Deactivation for non-target or healthy antigens (Y=0).
   - Make the diagram highly **personalized** according to the antigens selected by the user.

3. **Interactive Features**:
   - Add a **Refresh button (top right)** to reset all pages of the navigation pane and allow the user to input new antigens and logic selections from the beginning.
   - Display truth table, explanation, and CAR-T diagram side by side for clarity.

4. **Output Focus**:
   - Emphasize PDAC-targeted therapy.
   - Recommend the **best logic gate** for maximal tumor selectivity and minimal off-target effect.

Generate the result in a **ready-to-use interactive dashboard format** where the user can select antigens, logic gates, and immediately see the truth table, explanation, and personalized CAR-T diagram.
